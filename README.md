# Heatwave Detection and Notification System

This script detects heatwaves in historical temperature data and sends notifications via SMS when a heatwave is detected. The script uses Python, Pandas, and Twilio API for SMS notifications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Twilio Python Library

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas twilio
```

## Setup
1. **Twilio Account**: Sign up for a Twilio account to obtain an `account_sid` and `auth_token`.
2. **CSV Data**: Ensure you have a CSV file (`historical_temperature_data.csv`) with temperature data in the following format:
   ```csv
   Date,Temperature
   2023-06-01,32
   2023-06-02,33
   ...
   ```
3. **Environment Variables**: For security, you may want to store your Twilio credentials (`account_sid` and `auth_token`) in environment variables rather than directly in the code.

## Usage
1. **Load Temperature Data**: The script reads historical temperature data from a CSV file.
2. **Detect Heatwaves**: The `detect_heatwaves` function identifies heatwaves based on a temperature threshold and a minimum number of consecutive days.
3. **Send SMS Notifications**: When a heatwave is detected, an SMS is sent to the specified phone number.

Run the script with:
```bash
python heatwave_detection.py
```

## Functions

### detect_heatwaves
```python
def detect_heatwaves(data, threshold=30, consecutive_days=3):
```
This function takes in temperature data and detects heatwaves based on a temperature threshold and consecutive days. It returns a modified DataFrame with a `heatwave` column indicating days when a heatwave is detected.

#### Parameters
- `data`: Pandas DataFrame with temperature data.
- `threshold`: Temperature threshold for a heatwave (default is 30°C).
- `consecutive_days`: Minimum consecutive days to classify a heatwave (default is 3 days).

### send_sms
```python
def send_sms(to, message):
```
This function sends an SMS notification to a specified phone number using Twilio.

#### Parameters
- `to`: Phone number to send the SMS to.
- `message`: Message content for the SMS.

## Disclaimer
- **Sensitive Information**: Do not hardcode sensitive information like Twilio credentials or phone numbers in your code. Use environment variables for added security.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that phone numbers and temperature data are handled in compliance with data protection regulations.
